This workspace tracks the **February 2026 USTRY oracle manipulation** that drained the Blend Protocol (YieldBlox Pool) on the Stellar network. **Blend and the Reflector Oracle both functioned exactly as designed.** The attacker exploited the thin on-chain liquidity of USTRY — a low-volume asset — to artificially inflate its DEX price, which the oracle read as the real market price. With USTRY collateral suddenly valued at an inflated rate, the attacker borrowed ~61.2 million XLM against it and walked away. The Blend protocol and community were the target; no code was broken.

## Exploit Mechanics

**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Target:** Blend Protocol YieldBlox pool on Stellar  
**Asset Manipulated:** USTRY (normal price ~1.06 USDC)

### The Exploit TX (CONFIRMED)

**TX:** [`3e81a3f7b6e17cc22d0a1f33e9dcf90e5664b125b9e61f108b8d2f082f2d4657`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/3e81a3f7b6e17cc22d0a1f33e9dcf90e5664b125b9e61f108b8d2f082f2d4657)  
**Time:** 2026-02-22 00:24:27 UTC | **Ledger:** 61340408 | **Fee:** 0.0532048 XLM

The attacker called `submit` on the Blend Pool contract with `request_type: 4` (Borrow), resulting in **61,249,278.3 XLM** drained from the pool.

#### 🔴 The Suspicious Price Jump

The Reflector Oracle posts a new price every **5 minutes** (300-second intervals). The exploit borrow transaction closed at **00:24:27 UTC**. Working back from that anchor:

| Unix Timestamp | UTC Time | USTRY Price (raw) | Status |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 1771718700 | 00:05:00 UTC | 105,742,642,288,368 | ✅ Normal |
| 1771719000 | 00:10:00 UTC | 105,742,379,403,813 | ✅ Normal |
| **1771719300** | **00:15:00 UTC** | **10,673,728,301,028,137** | **⚠️ 100x JUMP — manipulation captured** |
| **1771719600** | **00:20:00 UTC** | **10,673,728,301,028,137** | **⚠️ Still inflated** |

The price of USTRY jumped **~100x** at 00:15 UTC — over 9 minutes before the borrow. The oracle did not malfunction; it read the DEX price, which the attacker had already manipulated via thin USTRY liquidity. The oracle confirmed the inflation again at 00:20, and the attacker executed the borrow at 00:24:27 UTC.

#### ⏱️ Attack Timeline

```
< 00:15:00 UTC   Attacker manipulates USTRY DEX pool price on Stellar
                 (thin liquidity = small trade moves price dramatically)

  00:15:00 UTC   Reflector Oracle posts → reads manipulated DEX price
                 USTRY: ~1.06 USDC → ~106.7 USDC (100x inflated)
                 [first inflated reading — TWAP clock starts]

  00:20:00 UTC   Reflector Oracle posts again → price still inflated
                 [second inflated reading — TWAP now has 2/4 periods inflated]
                 TWAP effective multiplier: ~51x above normal

  00:24:27 UTC   Attacker executes borrow on Blend Pool
                 61,249,278 XLM borrowed against ~$159K of real USTRY collateral
                 Pool drained instantly
```

> **Minimum manipulation window: 9+ minutes** (00:15 first inflation → 00:24:27 borrow). The attacker kept the USTRY DEX price inflated across two consecutive oracle windows and executed the borrow 4 min 27 sec after the final confirmation. This rules out flash-loan style atomicity — sustained DEX position required.

## Liquidation Cascade (Post-Exploit Auctions)


The oracle manipulation and resulting bad debt triggered a cascade of Blend liquidation auctions. Victims who had positions in the pool were forcibly liquidated. **Auction bots stepped in to fill these auctions**, paying off liabilities (USDC, USTRY, EURC, CETES) and receiving discounted collateral (XLM) in return.

**Auction Dashboard:** [blend.xlm.sh/auction](https://blend.xlm.sh/auction/?poolId=CCCCIQSDILITHMM7PBSLVDT5MISSY7R26MNZXCX4H7J5JQ5FPIYOGYFS)

### Verified Auction Statistics

> **Note:** Data sourced directly from Soroban `fill_auction` events emitted by the Blend Pool contract (`CCCCIQSD...`). Each fill verified via `getTransaction` RPC confirming the Blend Pool contract ID and `submit`/`auct_type` parameters in the transaction envelope.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Auction Fills (verified)** | **60** |
| **Total XLM Collateral Received** | **83,090,246.91 XLM** |
| **Total BLND-USDC LP Received** | **4,388,095.55 LP tokens** |
| **Total USDC Liability Paid** | **3,394,507.20 USDC** |
| **Total CETES Liability Paid** | **2,252,665.74 CETES** |
| **Fills by `GAPU4...XLIQ`** | **19** |
| **Fills by `GAIN2...YHNF`** | **31** |
| **Fills by `GDQY3...BLEND`** | 7 |
| **Fills by `GALB7...CASH`, `GCBYM...M3L`, `GASND...QXJ`** | 1 each |

### Collateral Captured by Filler

XLM price: **$0.1609** — taken directly from the Reflector Oracle in the exploit transaction. Stablecoins at $1. BLND-USDC LP has no reliable on-chain price and is tracked separately.

| Filler | Fills | Priced Collateral (USD) | Share | BLND-USDC LP (units) | LP Share |
|--------|-------|------------------------|-------|----------------------|----------|
| **`G...XLIQ`** | **19** | **$12,459,547** | **91.4%** | 1,447,148 | 33.0% |
| **`G...YHNF`** | **31** | **$901,336** | **6.6%** | 2,940,948 | 67.0% |
| `G...LEND` | 7 | $260,778 | 1.9% | — | — |
| Others | 3 | $4,084 | 0.0% | — | — |
| **XLIQ + YHNF combined** | **50** | **$13,360,884** | **98.1%** | 4,388,096 | 100% |

**XLIQ and YHNF together captured over 98% of all measurable liquidation value across 60 fills.** Even excluding the unpriced BLND-USDC LP tokens entirely, the 98.1% figure holds. The minimum defensible floor is **>90%**.

### Top 3 Liquidated Positions (by XLM seized)

| Rank | Liquidated Account | Fills | XLM Collateral | Other Collateral |
|------|--------------------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **#1** | `GCA34HBKNLWN3AOXWBRW5Y3HSGHCWF3UDBRJ5YHGU6HWGJZEPO2NSXI3` | 9 | **77,848,371.53 XLM** | — |

`G...SXI3` alone accounted for **93.6%** of all XLM seized across all 60 auctions.

**`G...SXI3` split by filler:**
- `G...XLIQ` — 7 fills, **76,341,176.58 XLM** (98.1%)
- `G...YHNF` — 2 fills, **1,507,194.95 XLM** (1.9%)

### The 4 Largest Fills (Single Position: `GCA34H...SXI3`)


All 4 occurred within a **25-ledger window (~2 minutes)** against the same liquidated account.

## G...XLIQ — Liquidator Deep Dive

**19 fills | $12.46M collateral seized | First mover (11 min after exploit)**

`GAPU4WSJMFW6Q4G5CLADCNWFIAOGTCC5XXY3DVUA23W7ZPUIYSSGXLIQ`

XLIQ is a sophisticated, protocol-native Blend liquidation operator. Its capital chain traces back five hops through a [Spoofing]-tagged origin account. Conclusory link to YieldBlox DAO is unconfirmed but circumstantially strong — XLIQ holds BLND, deployed a custom relay contract, and was first to fill just 11 minutes post-exploit.

→ **[Full identity and funding network deep dive: XLIQ.md](XLIQ.md)**

### Is XLIQ Affiliated with YieldBlox DAO?

**Not provably confirmed, but circumstantial evidence is compelling:**

1. **No on-chain tag** — no federation address, no StellarExpert directory label, no public statement linking this wallet to YieldBlox DAO.
2. **YieldBlox = Blend** — YieldBlox (by Script3) rebranded to Blend Protocol. Being the dominant Blend liquidator is as close to "YieldBlox DAO" as exists on-chain.
3. **Matches official bot profile** — the `blend-capital/liquidation-bot` GitHub requires the operator account to hold collateral in the pool; XLIQ does, in size.
4. **Holds BLND tokens** — retail liquidators don't typically hold significant BLND protocol tokens.
5. **Custom automation contract** — XLIQ deployed their own relay contract (`CB5AKVUU...`) rather than running the open-source bot directly, indicating serious custom infrastructure.
6. **First mover (Fill #1, 11 min after exploit)** — implies pre-positioned monitoring, not a retail user who saw the news.

**Conclusion:** XLIQ is a sophisticated, protocol-native Blend liquidation operator. It could be a Blend/Script3 team member's bot, a DAO treasury operator, or a professional MEV firm. Cannot be confirmed as YieldBlox DAO from on-chain data alone — would require Discord/governance cross-reference.

## XLIQ Funding Network Deep Dive

The capital chain funding XLIQ traces back five hops to an account tagged **[Spoofing]** by StellarExpert.

### Direct Funders of XLIQ (verified on-chain, 1000-payment sample)

| Source | Asset | Total Sent to XLIQ | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| `...3ILW` (hub) | USDC | **$3,577,993** | 8 direct payments |
| `...RHU7` (treasury) | USDC | via RHU7 → XLIQ | RHU7 itself received from 3ILW |

`...3ILW` also sent `...RHU7` **750,000 XLM + $1,004,112 USDC** in the same 1000-payment window, making it the sole funding source for the entire XLIQ operation.

| **Created by** | `...KLDC` on **2025-12-09T13:51:21Z** (starting balance: 1.5 XLM) |
| **Last instance** | Re-created by `...KLDC` on **2026-02-22T15:07:29Z** |
| **Lifespan** | ~12 seconds per run |
| **Operation** | Created → fires 4,358,826 XLM to `...3ILW` → sends 0.001 XLM dust ack to `...3ILW` → `account_merge` back to `...KLDC` |
| **Status** | Deleted (404) — merged into `...KLDC` on 2026-02-22T15:07:41Z |

`...TWA2` is a single-use relay envelope. It is spawned, fires one large payment, and self-destructs via `account_merge` within seconds. All residual XLM is returned to `...KLDC` via the merge.

### Tier 3 — `...KLDC` (Relay Dispatcher)

| Field | Value |

| **Last active** | 2026-02-23T02:38:19Z |
| **Trustlines** | None |
| **Home domain** | None |

`...KLDC` spawns disposable relay accounts (like `...TWA2`), each of which fires a large XLM payment into `...3ILW` and then merges back. Confirmed relay accounts that merged **back into `...KLDC`** include:
- `...JNL6` (`GABFJIMI52DCECD7ZSMNEFCNEYKREJOKPQCM2QX5UKCVY3UHHA77JNL6`) — merged into KLDC on 2026-02-23T02:38:19Z
- `...W54` (`GD5I54RP2IHR3G42PYUMHJ2GAGWFAAUGCLP2V25HSYGY6PY3JDYZCW54`) — merged same block
- `...BAVV` (`GBALHMMMQDMHZQOCTSR6JLX6TORGLDHOIAMARIA76JRF3JAAM77JBAVV`) — merged same block

`...JNL6` is also a **top outbound recipient** from `...3ILW` (5.15M XLM out), confirming that `...3ILW` → `...JNL6` → merge into `...KLDC` is a closed XLM recycling loop.

## G...YHNF — Liquidator Deep Dive

**31 fills | $901K collateral seized | 10.6M XLM held post-exploit**

`GAIN2HU2ITUZPLGNWSH7JXXROL7MYIWDYXCUQDMQVJXFBEBPETSZYHNF`

YHNF is a professional, protocol-connected Blend liquidation operator. It was seeded with BLND by a large protocol-level holder, received 80,000 USDC from a 4-signer controller on exploit day, and executed the most fills (31) of any single liquidator. Post-exploit it distributed proceeds via claimable balances back to its controller.

→ **[Full identity and controller deep dive: YHNF.md](YHNF.md)**

### Controller: `GDDYERCLIKAEDJJQI6XWWPLTOZ7OPOH26LFLNUD43QP4UEH34YEOV4A7`

This 4-signer multisig (weights 8/8/8/1) is the clearest link to YHNF's operator:

- Sent YHNF **100,000 BLND** (2025-08-20) + **276,632 BLND** (2025-08-27) — BLND distribution for protocol participation
- Sent YHNF **80,000 USDC** on **2026-02-22** (exploit day) — operating capital wired in same day as liquidations
- Signers: `GAMEYWUCSHCK3IOJWA5I`, `GCIPGRNCW7KBJZXRZ`, `GDOVD6A6YCU2J2ZPRA` (wt=8 each)

### BLND Whale Connection: `GCJ2VBYRO4BO3BHCGN7EMSTKBLQXMUTS67PFHUJBZOCCQGLOQN5XFKOG`

Holds **7,579,191 BLND** — one of the largest BLND holders on-chain (likely Blend DAO treasury or protocol reserve). This account:
- Sent YHNF **699,990 BLND** in Dec 2025, received **700,000 BLND** back in Jan 2026
- The round-trip suggests BLND was temporarily delegated to YHNF for voting/staking, then recalled

### Operator Cluster — YHNF, GASND, and GBAQG3 Are Co-Participants

`GASND6BBFGDGWDLP2DJCFDAKL7GHHZAYQ6PENFHSHMLEMFKAVLZCDQXJ` (**Fill #56** in our auction report) also sent BLND to YHNF. This clusters YHNF and GASND as accounts operated by the same entity — likely a Blend-community-aligned operator group.

### Creation Timing is Suspicious

YHNF was created **2025-04-15** — 8 days before `G...SXI3` (the Blend Treasury) was created on **2025-04-23**. Both accounts were set up in the same April 2025 operational window, suggesting YHNF was prepared as a liquidation bot in parallel with the treasury deployment.

### Key Finding

**No direct link to SDF or the attacker.** YHNF is a professional, protocol-connected Blend liquidation operator — likely run by a Blend DAO participant or aligned MEV firm. It was seeded with BLND by a large protocol-level holder and received USDC from a 4-signer controller on the day of the exploit. The 31 fills and 10.6M XLM profit place it squarely as the second-largest beneficiary of the liquidation cascade after `G...XLIQ`.

### Post-Exploit Activity

After completing its 31 fills, YHNF began creating **claimable balances** — distributing its seized collateral (XLM, CETES, USDC, EURC, USDGLO) to the controller multisig `G...V4A7`. This is consistent with a bot returning profits to its operator wallet via Stellar's native claimable balance mechanism rather than a direct transfer, which avoids triggering on-chain payment alerts.

## G...SXI3 — Blend Treasury Deep Dive

The largest liquidated position — `GCA34HBKNLWN3AOXWBRW5Y3HSGHCWF3UDBRJ5YHGU6HWGJZEPO2NSXI3` — was not a retail user. It is an institutional multisig account that functions as the **Blend Protocol's primary liquidity treasury**.

| **Current Holdings** | ~$11M+: 11.1M USDC, 1.8M CETES, 919K XLM, 37.9K EURC, 27.8K USDGLO |
| **Liquidated for** | ~70.68M XLM collateral (fills #12–18, 2-minute window) |

**Why this is the Blend Protocol Treasury:**
1. Created by a BLND-holding insider account (`G...QSRR`)
2. SDF directly funded it with ~511.8M XLM across 17 wires
3. 11-signer institutional multisig — matches a protocol treasury governance structure
4. $11M in stablecoins + yield assets (USDC, CETES, EURC) — a lending pool reserve
5. Held the largest Blend pool collateral position by far

## SDF Funding Network

On-chain investigation reveals that the liquidated Blend treasury (`G...SXI3`) was funded by a network of accounts traceable directly to the **Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)**.

### SDF Confirmation

Account `GAKGC35HMNB7A3Q2V5SQU6VJC2JFTZB6I7ZW77SJSMRCOX2ZFBGJOCHH` is **confirmed SDF** via StellarExpert directory: labeled **[SDF Direct Development (Hot 2)]**, tagged `#sdf`, associated with `stellar.org`, holds 189M XLM.

**98.8% of all XLM ever deposited into the Blend treasury came from the SDF network.** The ~70.68M XLM that was liquidated in the exploit is the pool's outstanding collateral position at exploit time — the rest had been lent, earned yield, or cycled back through the protocol over 10 months of operation.

### Key Accounts in the Funding Network

### Shared Signer — The Cluster Proof

`GDSZIVR5B776NB5RMS267M4JSRBFPJUMZCCURAV6PYAFPI3OV7LIMSQI` appears as a signer on **both** `GCB426VZ` (weight 3) and `GCUIXCRGWHF45VJ` (weight 1). These accounts are **co-controlled** by the same operator entity.

### BLND Governance Token Issuer — Confirmed Real

The 1,117,929.73 BLND tokens sent from `G...PZNP` to `G...SXI3` (GCA34H) are **legitimate Blend Protocol governance tokens**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Issuer** | `GDJEHTBE6ZHUXSWFI642DCGLUOECLHPF3KSXHPXTSTJ7E3JF6MQ5EZYY` |
| **Home Domain** | None |
| **Thresholds** | All 88 — self weight 0 = **permanently locked** |
| **Mechanism** | Soroban SAC (Stellar Asset Contract) controls minting; account cannot sign |
| **Claimable Balance BLND** | 389,808.65 BLND in active distributions |

This is the standard Soroban-native token pattern: the issuer account is rendered non-signing, with a smart contract exclusively managing supply. All BLND from this issuer are authentic.

### Significance

The SDF-linked accounts deployed capital into the Blend treasury, making `G...SXI3` the largest single position in the pool by a wide margin — **77.85M XLM** of collateral. When the oracle exploit hit:

- `G...SXI3` was forcibly liquidated across 9 fills, yielding the overwhelming majority of all seized collateral
- `G...XLIQ` captured **76.4M XLM** total across all 60 fills (91.4% of all priced collateral at $0.1609 = **~$12.3M**) — with the SDF treasury position as its primary source
- The exploit was not just a DeFi hack — it was a precision strike on an institutional liquidity position, with two pre-positioned bots (XLIQ + YHNF) ready to sweep the resulting auctions

## XLM Laundering Network

The attacker drained 61,249,278 XLM. Per mootz12 (Blend core team): **"48M XLM frozen, 13M XLM and 1M USDC were bridged out."**

~48M XLM remains frozen across three wallets. The remaining ~13M was moved through 5 intermediary wallets to two exchanges (Binance and ChangeNow) and one DEX conversion pipeline. Each withdrawal was preceded by a 0.001 XLM dust payment from a paired trigger address (automated C2 pattern).

### Swap Hub Pattern (`G...MVZH`)

The Swap Hub received 8M XLM and ran a cycle: create throwaway account → load XLM → `path_payment_strict_send` (DEX swap to USDC) → `account_merge` throwaway → bridge USDC via Allbridge. Known USDC proceeds: $787,167 total across 3 self-swaps + 4 throwaway merges, plus 150,000 USDC returned to the main wallet.

### Dust-Signal C2

Each intermediary has a paired trigger address sending exactly 0.001 XLM as a "go" signal before batch withdrawals:

### Net Extraction Summary

The attacker drained **two separate assets** from Blend: 61,249,278 XLM and ~$1,000,000 USDC.
These produced **two independent USDC bridge streams**:

**Stream 1 — Direct USDC Borrow (~$997.7K)**
The ~$1M USDC borrowed directly from the pool was immediately bridged off-chain via Allbridge Soroban calls directly from the main attacker wallet (`GBO7VUL2...C2WXC`). This is the bridge data we already have:

| Chain | Amount | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Base | ~$787,000 | ⚡ Active swapping (converted to ETH) |
| Ethereum | ~$172,000 | 💤 Forwarded to accumulator |
| BSC | ~$38,700 | 💤 Untouched |
| **Stream 1 Total** | **~$997,700** | |

**Stream 2 — XLM → USDC Conversion ($787K)**
~5M XLM was routed through GATDQL767ZM2 (Primary Swap Hub) and 4 throwaway accounts, converted to USDC via `path_payment_strict_send`, then bridged via 16 Allbridge Soroban calls to Base chain.

**On-chain confirmed spot price at ledger 61340408 (00:24:27 UTC): $0.16065/XLM**

## Cross-Chain Bridge (Allbridge)

The attacker uses **Allbridge Core Bridge** via Soroban's `swap_and_bridge` function to move USDC off Stellar.

### Decoding `swap_and_bridge` Parameters (XDR)

```
Param 5 → Amount (U128): e.g., 50,000 USDC (7 decimal places)
Param 6 → Destination Address (Bytes): 32-byte field, last 20 bytes = EVM address
Param 7 → Chain ID (U32): 9 = Base
Param 8 → Token Address (Bytes): 32-byte field, last 20 bytes = EVM token contract
```

### Python Decode Script

```python
import base64, struct

# Chain ID
chain_bytes = base64.b64decode('AAAAAwAAAAk=')
chain_id = struct.unpack('>I', chain_bytes[4:])[0]  # → 9 (Base)

# Destination EVM Address
dest_bytes = base64.b64decode('AAAADQAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtHOKbSvFftudrqZlbvhQh6FRkgg==')
evm_addr = '0x' + dest_bytes[8:][-20:].hex()  # → 0x2d1ce29b4af15fb6e76ba9995bbe1421e8546482

# Token on destination chain
token_bytes = base64.b64decode('AAAADQAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACDNYn81u224I9MfDLU9xtUvaApEw==')
evm_token = '0x' + token_bytes[8:][-20:].hex()  # → 0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913 (USDC on Base)

# Amount
amt_bytes = base64.b64decode('AAAACQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdGpSiAA=')
hi = struct.unpack('>Q', amt_bytes[4:12])[0]
lo = struct.unpack('>Q', amt_bytes[12:20])[0]
amount = ((hi << 64) | lo) / 10**7  # → 50,000.0 USDC
```
